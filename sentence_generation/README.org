This folder contains simple_sentence_generator.py file for homework and the markov_lyrics_generator.py challenge for the async homework.
There are also text files for the song lyrics generator.

In the markov_lyrics_generator.py file I tried to print line breaks and omit "[Chorus]".
I'm not sure if there is a better way to do these things, but it seems to work for my program.
